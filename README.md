#StaffFuel

StaffFuel is a food application for hospitals that offers healthy food options for hospital staff and eliminates the need for its employees to wait in line. This app is designed to encourage hospital staff to make nutritious food choices, 
leading to improved overall health, enhanced performance and improved focus and productivity in the work place, which can in turn, positively impact patient care and outcomes. Because hospital staff also work long stressful hours, it may be challenging 
to maintain a healthy diet, and so a healthy food app can assist them in making informed choices and reduce their risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. The app offers the benefits of convenience and saving time as hospital 
staff working in high-stress environments may struggle to find time for meal planning and preparation. Having a healthy food app can provide staff with easy and healthier food recipes to choose from and saves time and effort, making staff more 
likely to choose healthy food options. 

StaffFuel will only collect essential data from hospital staff needed to run the service, such as employee ID number, full name, email and payment. 

Although there are some healthy food apps that have been implemented in hospitals worldwide, they only seem to cater for the patients only and not the hospital staff. The benefits are:
1) StaffFuel is designed for staff. We believe that providing healthy food options for hospital staff will have a positive impact on their physical, emotional and mental performance as well as patient care and outcomes.
In order to retain a healthy workforce, having healthy food options is where it starts. We cannot forget about our wonderful staff who do a good job looking after our patients, so to continue this we must look after them too.
2) StaffFuel will also reduce healthcare costs. By improving the overall health of hospital staff, the likelihood of chronic diseases and medical expenses will decrease.
3) StaffFuel will foster a sense of community engagement. Promoting wellness challenges, sharing success stories and facilitating social interactions can lead to a supportive environment where staff motivate and inspire
   each other to lose weight, make healthier choices and create healthier behaviours.
